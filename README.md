This is a project where I tried to recreate Ben Eaters 8-bit CPU using Logisim and subsequently upgraded it to 16-bit and 32-bit and added several new functionalities such as an extended ALU and and floating point operations. Hope you like it and I would be more than happy about feedback!

Please excuse my very rough GitHub repo. I'm verny new and only learning but I thought this would be the best way for everyone to play around with what I made.
